## 🚢 1. Titanic Survival Prediction

### 📌 Project Objective
To analyze the Titanic passenger dataset and identify factors that influenced **survival probability**.

### 📊 Dataset Details
- Titanic Dataset (CSV)
- Features:
  - Passenger Class (Pclass)
  - Sex
  - Age
  - Fare
  - Embarked
  - Survival Status

### 🔍 Analysis & Visualizations
- Data loading and inspection
- Handling missing values
- Survival analysis based on:
  - Gender
  - Passenger Class
- Count plot (Survived vs Gender)
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### 📈 Key Insights
- Females had a significantly higher survival rate than males
- Higher-class passengers had better survival chances
- Gender and class were major survival factors

## 🌸 2. Iris Flower Classification

### 📌 Project Objective
To analyze and visualize the **Iris Flower dataset** and understand relationships between flower features.

### 📊 Dataset Details
- Iris Dataset
- Features:
  - Sepal Length
  - Sepal Width
  - Petal Length
  - Petal Width
  - Species

### 🔍 Analysis & Visualizations
- 3D Scatter Plot
- Pair Plot to show feature relationships
- Distribution plots for each species
- Feature-wise comparison

### 📈 Key Insights
- Petal features clearly separate flower species
- Strong correlation between petal length and petal width
- Iris-setosa is easily distinguishable from other species

## 📈 3. Prediction & Data Visualization using Python

### 📌 Project Objective
To analyze numerical data and identify relationships using data visualization techniques.

### 📊 Dataset Details
- Advertising / Sales Dataset
- Features:
  - TV Advertising Cost
  - Radio Advertising Cost
  - Newspaper Advertising Cost
  - Sales

### 🔍 Analysis & Visualizations
- Scatter plots for relationship analysis
- Box plot for sales distribution
- Line plot for trend analysis
- Distribution plots

### 📈 Key Insights
- TV advertising shows a strong positive relationship with sales
- Radio and newspaper advertising are less predictable
